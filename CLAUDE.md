## Brand System

**Colors (Public Record Elegance palette):**
- Primary red: `#B91C1C` (CTAs, danger states only)
- Dark blue: `#1a5276` (accent, links) — replaced teal `#0C7489`
- Near-black: `#1b1b1b` (text)
- White: `#ffffff` (backgrounds) — replaced warm off-white `#f8f7f5`
- Secondary text: `#474747`
- Muted text: `#6e6e6e`
- Borders: `#e2e2e2`

**Typography:**
- Display: Cormorant Garamond (h1, h2)
- Body: Source Serif 4 (prose) — replaced Inter for body text
- UI/nav: Inter (sans-serif)
- Data/mono: IBM Plex Mono

**Logo:** "ART" wordmark — Cormorant Garamond Medium (500) glyph outlines with red underline bar. Extracted via fonttools from CormorantGaramond-Medium.ttf (SIL OFL). Two variants: `art-logo.svg` (light, #1b2127) and `art-logo-dark.svg` (dark, #f8f7f5). ViewBox: 0 0 1994 747.

**CSS custom properties:** New semantic tokens use `--bg-*`, `--text-*`, `--accent`, `--border-*`, `--link-*` prefixes. Legacy `--art-*` tokens aliased to new values for backwards compatibility.

## Development

**Local build:**
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**Key files:**
- `_config.yml` — site configuration
- `_includes/` — nav, footer, head, components
- `_layouts/` — default, page, post, landing
- `assets/css/main.css` — core styles (~71KB, `--art-*` tokens)
- `assets/css/elegant.css` — design layer (~33KB)
- `assets/js/` — nav, theme toggle, animations

## Content Guidelines

1. **Fiduciary-first framing** — financial merit and legal standards, not political arguments
2. **Source everything** — every factual claim must trace to a FOIA document
3. **Issuer-neutral language** — all campaign-voice content uses financial terminology ("non-marketable foreign sovereign debt," "non-tradable sovereign bonds," "the bonds under investigation") rather than naming the bond issuer. Official quotes stay verbatim with "From the public record:" prefix. The glossary page (`/glossary/`) explains the approach and provides the financial profile. See `REFRAME-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the complete terminology table.
4. **No BDS self-identification** — this is a transparency and accountability campaign
5. **Current data only** — keep stats updated (ATRS: $23.7B, ~84% funded; APERS: $11.58B, ~83% funded)
6. **Corpus state** — 1,227 total documents (1,044 active after dedup) from the producing-docs agencies (Treasury, ATRS, APERS, ASHERS, Auditor); 12 FOIA requests across 4 rounds to 8 state entities (six pension systems covered by Act 498 plus Treasury and Auditor of State); AJRS Round 4 filed May 8, 2026 and acknowledged by Richmond Giles (APERS Staff Attorney handling both pension systems' legal); production extended to May 15, 2026

## Accessibility

- WCAG AA compliance target
- Skip links, semantic HTML, ARIA labels
- Dark mode support with opacity-based logo crossfade
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus indicators
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for all transitions
- `aria-hidden` managed dynamically on inactive logo variants

## Audit Log — March 27, 2026

### PR #2: Critical structural fixes

**CRITICAL-1 — Nav HTML/CSS mismatch:** `nav.html` had been restructured with CSS classes that had zero definitions. Reverted to reference site structure with ART brand changes only.

**CRITICAL-2 — Dark mode broken:** Theme toggle button missing `id` attribute + localStorage key mismatch (`art-theme` vs `d4arf-theme`). Both fixed.

**MEDIUM — robots.txt:** Restored OAI-SearchBot and PerplexityBot allow rules.

**LOW:** Removed unused d4arf-logo PNG files.

### PR #3: Logo replacement

Replaced hand-drawn geometric SVG with Cormorant Garamond Medium (500) glyph outlines extracted via fonttools. Red underline bar height set to 55 units (renders ~2px at nav size). Trailing newlines added to all files.

### PR #4: Theme polish + CSS rename

**Logo crossfade:** Changed from `display:none/block` to `opacity:0/1` with absolute positioning. Eliminates layout shift during toggle and between-page logo flash.

**Anti-FOUC inline style:** Expanded to cover logo stacking, pointer-events, and explicit opacity values.

**CSS rename:** Full `--d4arf-*` → `--art-*` custom property rename across all 5 CSS files.

**JS improvements:** `prefers-reduced-motion` guard skips `theme-transition` class entirely. `updateLogoAria()` manages `aria-hidden` on inactive logo. Uses `removeAttribute` (not `"false"`).

**Print URL:** Set to `arpensions.org`.

### PR #5: Final comment cleanup

Renamed "D4ARF" → "ART" in source code comments: `charts.js` line 2, `network.css` line 3, `network.js` line 2.

#### Known remaining items

All previously tracked items (og-default.png branding, favicon.ico branding) resolved as of March 29, 2026.
